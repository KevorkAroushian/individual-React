              I love my engagement ring from <br /> Studio Moone because my fianc√©
              <br /> worked closely with them to design <br /> the ring literally just
              for me!

              My mom loved the earrings I gave <br /> her for her birthday. She loved
              that it <br /> was handmade and personalized. <br /> Thinking of
              getting a pair for <br /> myself, too!
